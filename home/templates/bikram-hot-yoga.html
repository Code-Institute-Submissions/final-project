                    <p>This is a routine of 26 yoga postures, which works the whole body. This is an exhilarating class flowing from posture to posture stretching and toning every part of the body from the inside and out. Practised in a heated room to help you sweat out toxins, help you stretch deeper into postures avoiding injury and with the potential to lose up to 1,000 calories per class.</p>

                    <p>At the studio we have installed Longwave Infrared Heaters as used by Physiotherapists which are regarded as the most therapeutic heat available heating the body the same as natural sun light.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading text-center text-uppercase mb-3"> What exactly is Bikram Hot Yoga and why the heat?</h3>
                    <p>It has been proved and experienced by millions that these 26 postures systematically work every part of the body, to give all the internal organs, all the veins, all the ligaments, and all the muscles everything they need to maintain optimum health and maximum function. Yoga changes the construction of the body from the inside out, from bones to skin and from fingertips to toes. So before you change it, you have to heat it up to soften it, because a warm body is a flexible body. Then you can reshape the body any way you want.</p>
                    <p>Hot Yoga flushes away the waste products, the toxins of all the glands and organs of your body. It provides a natural irrigation of the body through the circulatory system, with the help of the respiratory system. It brings nourishments to every cell of your body so that each one can perform its function and keep your body healthy. Bikram Yoga also employs heat to further that cleaning process: When you sweat, impurities are flushed out of the body through the skin.</p>
                    <p>Practicing yoga not only increases our supplies of oxygen, but it also teaches us how to use that oxygen properly - we learn to control the breath through pranayama.</p>
