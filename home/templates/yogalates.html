                    <p>Yogalates method is a comprehensive exercise system which successfully fuses the practices of Yoga and Pilates. Since Yogalates was introduced to the Headford Wellbeing centre almost 3 years ago it has steadily gained popularity as being a method which makes the disciplines of Yoga and Pilates easily available to anyone. Yogalates effectively merges the ancient practice of Yoga from the east with the core stabilizing, posture enhancing dynamics of Pilates from the west.</p>
                    <p>YOGA postures enhance strength, tone, energy, stamina, improved flexibility, balance and mental clarity. Through developing a conscious awareness of the body, mind, and breath, it also has the ability to be deeply relaxing, health enhancing and in turn relieve stress.</p>
                    <p>Yoga works from the inside out. The reasons behind our enhanced levels of health are less understood. Each time you do Yoga you will stimulate, cleanse and nourish your body by compressing, stretching and massaging every gland and internal organ in your body, releasing toxins on a regular basis.

It promotes correct alignment and good posture . Pilates is a movement technique that creates an elongated and more balance body, firmer and flatter abdominals and a toned and stronger body.</p>
                    <p>Pilates can help enchance sporting activities, assist in injury rehabilitation and supports those with back problems through re-educating the body's postural muscles to create a very safe and strong foundation for movement.</p>
                    <h4 class="teal-h4">Pilates helps you achieve the suppleness, grace and skill that will be unmistakably reflected in the way you walk, the way you play and the way you work. </h4>
