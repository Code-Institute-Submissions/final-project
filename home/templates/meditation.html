                          <p>Meditation has been shown to be a powerful tool to release and manage stress and to help maintain a healthy balance of body and mind. By learning and practicing simple meditation and yogic breathing techniques the mind becomes more peaceful and healthy, creating a calmer more balanced state of being.</p>
                          <p>These tools when applied regularly create an awareness of life helping us become more present and focused in our daily lives by shifting our thoughts away from our usual preoccupations towards an appreciation of each moment, giving us a larger perspective on life.</p>
                          <p>We will work with the idea that it is not about forcing the mind to be quite but about finding the silence that is already there and making it a part of your daily life.</p>
                          <p>From this field of pure potentiality we get our bursts of inspiration, our most intuitive thoughts and our deepest sense of connection to ourselves and the universe.</p>

                          <p>It's a busy world. You fold the laundry while keeping one eye on the kids and another on the television. You plan your day while listening to the radio and commuting to work, and then plan your weekend. But in the rush to accomplish necessary tasks, you may find yourself losing your connection with the present moment, with yourself missing out on what you're doing and how you're feeling.</p>
                          <p>Meditation helps you become fully present and aware in each moment and accepting it without judgement. Whatever you do with awareness is Meditation.</p>
                          <p>Meditation begins when we discover that our never-ending quest to possess material things and our continual craving for pleasure and security can never be satisfied in the external world. When we finally realize this, our external quest turns inward, and we have shifted into the realm of meditation. Meditation is the cornerstone of yoga with many benefits one of the main ones being stress relief bringing you to a deeper sense of calm and relaxation.</p>
                          <p>Mindfulness Meditation is now being examined scientifically and has been found to be a key element in happiness.</p>
                          <p>Most people live whether physically, intellectually or morally in a very restricted circle of their potential being. We all have reservoirs of life to draw upon of which we do not even dream we have.</p>
                          <h4 class="teal-h4">Your mind is like a garden. If you care for your mind and nurture it and if you cultivate it just like a fertile garden it will blossom far beyond your expectations But if you let the weeds grow, lasting peace of mind and deep inner harmony will always elude you.</h4>
