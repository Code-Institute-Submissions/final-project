### Yoga Studio Site with Blog, Shop and Events - Full Stack Development Project for the Code Institute

This submission is part of the Fullstack Software Development diploma course offered by Code Institute.

## Overview

For my [final project] (https://deevdz-final-project.herokuapp.com/) for the Code Institute I have taken inspiration from my [First Milestone Project](https://deevdz.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html "First Milestone Project") and added features that I could only have dreamed of adding at the start of this process.

**What is this website for?** 

This Project is designed to allow users to view information and timetables for a yoga studio, to read articles from the blog and comment on articles, create an account and purchase various products from the site.

**What does it do?** 

The website provides an online presence for a yoga studio and allows users to register on it, log in and log out, to send an enquiry to the studio via the contact form and to purchase the products on offer on both the workshops page and the shop page. 

Users are also able to find out a bit about the studio, classes on offer, workshops available and read and comment on blog posts.

**How does it work?** 

The site's major functionality is to allow users to purchase gift vouchers, class packs and workshops. To be able to add items to their cart users must first register or login to the site. The final stage is to fill in some billing information (user can enter new information or use previously saved information) and enter debit/credit card details via stripe to complete the order. Users will receive an email notification of their order with instructions on how they will receive their product.

A blog section was also created which allows the user to page through multiple posts, comment on individual posts, search posts and filter posts by category or tag. Comments must be approved by the site administrator to appear on the site.

Additionally, the website allows users to submit an enquiry via the contact page. They will then get a reply to the email address they have indicated on the form, with a summary of their enquiry. Prior registration is not required to carry out this action.
