### Yoga Studio Site with Blog, Shop and Events - Full Stack Development Project for the Code Institute

This submission is part of the Fullstack Software Development diploma course offered by Code Institute.

## Overview

For my [final project](https://deevdz-final-project.herokuapp.com/) for the Code Institute I have taken inspiration from my [First Milestone Project](https://deevdz.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html "First Milestone Project") and added features that I could only have dreamed of adding at the start of this process.

**What is this website for?** 

This Project is designed to allow users to view information and timetables for a yoga studio, to read articles from the blog and comment on articles, create an account and purchase various products from the site.

**What does it do?** 

The website provides an online presence for a yoga studio and allows users to register on it, log in and log out, to send an enquiry to the studio via the contact form and to purchase the products on offer on both the workshops page and the shop page. 

Users are also able to find out a bit about the studio, classes on offer, workshops available and read and comment on blog posts.

**How does it work?** 

The site's major functionality is to allow users to purchase gift vouchers, class packs and workshops. To be able to add items to their cart users must first register or login to the site. The final stage is to fill in some billing information (user can enter new information or use previously saved information) and enter debit/credit card details via stripe to complete the order. Users will receive an email notification of their order with instructions on how they will receive their product.

A blog section was also created which allows the user to page through multiple posts, comment on individual posts, search posts and filter posts by category or tag. Comments must be approved by the site administrator to appear on the site.

Additionally, the website allows users to submit an enquiry via the contact page. They will then get a reply to the email address they have indicated on the form, with a summary of their enquiry. Prior registration is not required to carry out this action.

## Site Demo
You can see the deployed version of the site [here](https://deevdz-final-project.herokuapp.com/).

## UX

## Features

#### Existing Features
* Responsive design ensures the website displays well on any screen size and device type.
* User authentication and authorisation - handling registration, logging in and logging out users who are not logged in will see a Register and Log In options in the Navigation bar, but those who are - will see a view orders and Log Out options instead. Administrators will be given extra options to create, update and delete posts.
* Contact form functionality allows users to fill out a form, which after submission will trigger an email to be sent to them using Gmail SMTP (and my own Gmail account). Logged in users will have the email field of the contact form automatically populated.
* 





#### Future Features
* Filtering the workshops by location or month.
* Adding a shop that also sells physical products

## Testing

Testing for this project has been completed using both automated and manual methods. At the Code Insititute, we are encouraged to code using Test Driven Design methods. Automatic testing has never been my strong point, but testing itself is important. 

### Automated Testing

### Manual Testing

### Validators

#### HTML

Both the Base HTML file and other HTML templates were passed through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Numerous errors were generated but this was expected as the validator is unable to process the Django templating that builds most aspects of the site. 

For the HTML that does not involve this templating, no errors were found.

#### CSS

The CSS3 code was passed through the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and shows that there are no errors. A number of warnings were flagged and related to MS-Grid vendor prefixes.

#### Javascript

All Javascript code was passed through the [Esprima Syntax Validator](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) and was found to be syntactically valid.

#### Python

All Python code was passed through the [PEP8 Online validator](http://pep8online.com/) and is PEP8 compliant.
