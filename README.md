### Yoga Studio Site with Blog, Shop and Events - Full Stack Development Project for the Code Institute

This submission is part of the Fullstack Software Development diploma course offered by Code Institute.

## Overview

For my [final project](https://deevdz-final-project.herokuapp.com/) for the Code Institute I have taken inspiration from my [First Milestone Project](https://deevdz.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html "First Milestone Project") and added features that I could only have dreamed of adding at the start of this process.

**What is this website for?** 

This Project is designed to allow users to view information and timetables for a yoga studio, to read articles from the blog and comment on articles, create an account and purchase various products from the site.

**What does it do?** 

The website provides an online presence for a yoga studio and allows users to register on it, log in and log out, to send an enquiry to the studio via the contact form and to purchase the products on offer on both the workshops page and the shop page. 

Users are also able to find out a bit about the studio, classes on offer, workshops available and read and comment on blog posts.

**How does it work?** 

The site's major functionality is to allow users to purchase gift vouchers, class packs and workshops. To be able to add items to their cart users must first register or login to the site. The final stage is to fill in some billing information (user can enter new information or use previously saved information) and enter debit/credit card details via stripe to complete the order. Users will receive an email notification of their order with instructions on how they will receive their product.

A blog section was also created which allows the user to page through multiple posts, comment on individual posts, search posts and filter posts by category or tag. Comments must be approved by the site administrator to appear on the site.

Additionally, the website allows users to submit an enquiry via the contact page. They will then get a reply to the email address they have indicated on the form, with a summary of their enquiry. Prior registration is not required to carry out this action.

## Site Demo
You can see the deployed version of the site [here](https://deevdz-final-project.herokuapp.com/). Link to the [Administration Dashboard](https://deevdz-final-project.herokuapp.com/admin/).

#### Typography

Research was carried out on complimentary fonts and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) and [Prata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prata) were chosen for the site.

#### Colour Scheme and Logo

The studio is an established business so I am using the existing logo which I designed many years ago. I also have taken the existing colour scheme but extended it with the help of the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/392f23-7ab5a7-99b8d1-cecccc-9d6381) colour generator.

#### Wireframes

The wireframes for this site were generated using Adobe Illustrator. Wireframes for the site can be found in the folder [planning > wireframes](https://github.com/deevdz/final-project/tree/master/planning/wireframes).

## Features

#### Existing Features
* Responsive design ensures the website displays well on any screen size and device type.
* __Homepage slider__ was created which allows the site administrator to add slides through the administration section of the site. This feature allows the administrator to add a title and subtitle, slider image, text that will be displayed on the button, the link for the button and the alignment of the text. The administrator also has the option to leave the slide as a draft or publish to the site.
* __User authentication and authorisation__ - handling registration, logging in and logging out. Users who are not logged in will see Register and Log In options in the Navigation bar, but those who are logged in - will see a view orders and Log Out option instead. Administrators will be given extra options to create, update and delete posts. User Authentication was carried out using the [AllAuth app](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
* __Contact form__ functionality allows users to fill out a form, which after submission will trigger an email to be sent to them using Gmail SMTP (and my own Gmail account). Logged in users will have the email field of the contact form automatically populated.
* __Blog__ Administrators have the option to Create, Update and Delete Blog posts from both the frontend and backend administration part of the site. Registered users are able to submit comments on individual blog posts. When a comment is submitted the site administrator is automatically emailed about the submission and prompted to review for approval. When a comment is approved it appears on the site. Blog posts can be searched and also filtered by category or tag. Pagination is in place and 4 posts are displayed per page. Tags are generated using the [django-taggit app](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* __Product Pages__ - both a shop page and a workshop page was established on the site. Products were created using polymorphism. This allows the products to share common features but also allow products, in this case the workshops/events to have different product fields than other products. Workshops/Events have date and time fields, location of the event and the number of available places at this event.
* __Cart and Checkout functionality__ - the Cart app stores the information of each product that is added to it and displays a cart total. Users can increase, decrease and remove items from the cart. In relation to workshops there is a check in place to see if there are enough places available on the workshop. The Checkout app also stores this information and displays a total but additionally sends the user to a Stripe form to enter payment details. On successfully completing their order users can view their order and any preious orders. 
* __Error Pages__ The site features custom error pages for both 404 and 500 errors.


#### Future Features
* __Workshops/Events__ Filtering the workshops by location or month when the workshop is occuring.
* __Products and Checkout__ Adding a shop that also sells physical products hence adding an option for shipping cost and shipping address
* __Administration Dashboard__ Show a graphical representation of product sales.
* __Social Login__ Offer users the option to signup and login to the site via social media accounts.

## Testing

Testing for this project has been completed using both automated and manual methods. At the Code Insititute, we are encouraged to code using Test Driven Design methods. Automated testing has never been my strong point, but testing itself is important. For this project I have created automated tests, carried out extensive manual testing and passed the site code through validators.

### Automated Testing

Each app has their own tests created using Django TestCase class. All views, forms and pages were tested as much as possible using unit tests. In all, 24 tests were written. All tests pass successfully.

Travis-CI integration has been completed and also shows all tests completing successfully, with the project showing as "build: passing".

### Manual Testing

In conjunction with the automated testing the website was constantly tested during the development process. Browser developer tools were used to test HTML, CSS, JavaScript and responses from the server. Extensive manual testing has been completed to check that the site performs as it should in different environments and in different browsers.

<h5>Issues and Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Issue - had the search function working on the blog posts and then introduced the category count in the sidebar and found that the search was no longer working. Fix - Discovered that the order of the urls in the urls.py file is important. Once I updated the order of the urls my search worked again.</li>
<li>Issue - Polymorphic Products, I wanted to include an available number of places on workshop products. This caused issues when I wanted to decrease places on purchase for the other product types. Fix - introduced a product type dropdown and then checked the product type. If the product type is workshop then decrease the places available by the correct amount. If the product type is not workshop then ignore the places available decrease and move on with the order.</li>
<li>Issue - Removing items from the cart - I found that if I had more than one of a product type in the cart I had issues removing it from the cart. Fix - the remove from cart trashcan icon is only displayed when there is one of a product in the cart.</li>
<li>Issue - Comment counts. I wanted each post to display the number of comments that were associated with a blog post but my count was incorrect as it was counting all comments (including comments from other posts). Fix - Set up a get_comments property in the blog model that returned a count of only the comments associated with the post. I also introduced the approval system for comments as prior to this all comments were automatically displayed which could lead to inappropriate comments and/or spam.</li>
<li>Issue - Shop display on mobiles. I found that the products in the shop weren't displaying as I hoped on mobile devices. Fix - I used Javascript to atler classes based on the screen size.
</ul>

### Validators

#### HTML

Both the Base HTML file and other HTML templates were passed through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Numerous errors were generated but this was expected as the validator is unable to process the Django templating that builds most aspects of the site. 

For the HTML that does not involve this templating, no errors were found.

#### CSS

The CSS3 code was passed through the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and shows that there are no errors. A number of warnings were flagged and related to MS-Grid vendor prefixes.

#### Javascript

All Javascript code was passed through the [Esprima Syntax Validator](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) and was found to be syntactically valid.

#### Python

All Python code was passed through the [PEP8 Online validator](http://pep8online.com/) and is PEP8 compliant.


## Deployment

Having choosen Cloud9 as my IDE, the following steps were carried out:

* Install Python3 and Django to run the application.
* Create project - yogastudio
* Cloud9 included in the list of ALLOWED_HOSTS in staging settings, later heroku url will be added to ALLOWED_HOSTS
* Add run command to bashrc file 
* Create git repository - Initialise the repository, add files not required to the gitignore file. Carry out a `git add` and `git commit - "Initial Commit" `.
* Set up templates and static folders
* Create a env.py file containing the following environmental variables (add env.py file to the gitignore list):
 ```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE - Used solely to identify your account with Stripe; it isn't secret.
STRIPE_SECRET - Can perform any API request to Stripe without restriction.
DATABASE_URL - Remote PostgreSQL database link if using a remote database.
SECRET_KEY - Standard secret key, any value.
EMAIL_ADDRESS - to send correspondence from the site.
EMAIL_PASSWORD - authenticate email account.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS user credentials.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - AWS S3 credentials.
```
* Generate a requirements.txt file so Heroku can install the required dependencies to run the app. `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. The contents of the requirements.txt is referenced above.
* Python package gunicorn was installed
* Create a Procfile to tell Heroku what type of application is being deployed, and how to run it. `web: gunicorn yogastudio.wsgi:application`
* Create a new app on Heroku to host and run the site
* In Heroku go to resources and add a Postgres Database
* Retrieve the Postgres DB url and add to the env.py on cloud9
* In the settings.py file update the DB details to look at the DB hosted on Heroku
* This is followed by migrations `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `python3 manage.py migrate` to  create tables on heroku database.
* Create a super user on the new DB `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
* In Heroku, connect newly created app to the correct github repository.
* Set up config vars that are currently stored in our env.py file on Heroku.
* Create a bucket on Amazon S3, set up the appropriate permissions, groups, users and policies.
* In Cloud9 install the following: django-storages and boto3. `sudo pip3 install django-storages`, `sudo pip3 install boto3`, 
* Create a custom_storages.py file and add static file settings and media storage information to the setting.py file.
* Run `python3 manage.py collectstatic`
* Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with the value of 1 to the Config Variables on Heroku
* Enable automatic deploys from github to heroku.
* On completion of the project debug mode was set to False in the settings.py file.
